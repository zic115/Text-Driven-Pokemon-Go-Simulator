# Text-Driven-Pokemon-Go-Simulator

This was a programming project for CSE8B @UCSD.

`PokemonGame.java` was the main class file that includes unit tests and the call for the actual game.
`Item.java` is the super class for `Berry.java` and `Pokeball.java`.
`Pokeball.java`: A class that inherits from `Item.java` and represents the pokeball that is used to capture WildPokemons
